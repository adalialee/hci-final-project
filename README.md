**Time2Cook** aims to simplify the process of cooking through AI-powered recipe generation!

Cooking is often viewed as a time-consuming task, so students may resort to pre-prepared meals
or not eat at all when they have limited time between classes, work, and extracurriculars, which
can be less healthy and have a detrimental effect on their health. Meal planning and preparation
can be difficult, and there are so many recipes to choose from that someone may not know where
to begin. If students could take some of the guesswork out of the process, they may be
encouraged to cook more often.

Future features:
- weekly meal planning
- grocery lists
