# Time2Cook

**Time2Cook** aims to simplify the process of cooking through AI-powered recipe generation!

Cooking is often viewed as a time-consuming task, so students may resort to pre-prepared meals
or not eat at all when they have limited time between classes, work, and extracurriculars, which
can be less healthy and have a detrimental effect on their health. Meal planning and preparation
can be difficult, and there are so many recipes to choose from that someone may not know where
to begin. If students could take some of the guesswork out of the process, they may be
encouraged to cook more often.

Future features:

- weekly meal planning
- grocery lists

# Feedback Plan
We have created a prototype interface focusing on the largest challenge in the feedback we received in the interviews. For designing alternatives, we will create several iterations of our designs prioritizing solutions to the different common frustrations expressed by users, then prototype them. We will conduct user interviews for each of our iterations to gain more feedback. We will have them test out our different workflows and discuss what they liked and didnâ€™t like about each of them, to help guide further revisions to the interface and refine our end result.
